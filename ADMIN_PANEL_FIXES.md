# Admin Panel Issues Fixed

This document summarizes all the fixes implemented to resolve the admin panel issues.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Announcement Update Issue
**Problem**: Updating announcements was creating new ones instead of updating existing ones.
**Solution**: 
- Fixed backend `updateAnnouncement` controller method
- Added proper PUT route for announcements
- Updated frontend API service to use PUT method for updates
- Fixed frontend form handling to use correct API endpoint

### 2. ✅ Announcement Delete Issue
